#Base 5 including variable names for first five digits 0-4
#initialise/setup:

# let zero = '+'
# let one = '-'
# let double = '-'
# let ayeayeaye = '-'
# let eyeVee = '-'

# this is equivalent to the first digit zero,
# as zero is +ive and all other 4 are negative.

# Note: max and min one and one only must equal positive (+)
# and all other four must be equal to negative (-).

# This Base 5 "byte", rather than a binary "bit",
# could become useful.

# of course, Base 5 may be arbitrary but it's my chosen start point.
# whatever the starting number system / "Base",
# this can, through linear (Python) coding, be later
# metaphorically "boxed up" and the next level.of abstraction
# can be used.

# Firstly, a series of 5 digit bits could be strung together 
# to create a Base 5 PC hardware architecture
# through reverse engineering, depending on what 
# useful cases and purposes, if any, are found
# from this system.

# many happy returns,

# any advice on Python study resources appreciated
# any guidance on how to learn the difference between 
# compilers and assemblers also appreciated
